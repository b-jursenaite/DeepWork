# Deep Work

Personal summary of Deep Work by Cal Newport

## Willpower

* Willpower is a limited resource, not a character trait. It is like a muscle that can be trained.
* Use routines and rituals to minimize the need to resort to willpower.

## Modes of Work

* Monastic Weekends
* Rhythmic Weekdays

## How to ritualize

Decide on:

1. Where you'll work and for how long.
2. How you'll work once you start (keep efforts structured by instituting rules, such as "no internet" or metric such as "20 words per minute").
3. How you'll support your work. For example, you may need a coffee to start, or immediate access to food.

## 4DX

1. Focus on the wildly important. The more you try to do, the less you accomplish.
2. Act on lead measures: number of hours spent working deeply on the wildly important.
3. Keep a scoreboard.
4. Create a cadence of accountability.

## Walk in nature

... what the header says!

## Embrace Boredom

Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from dependence on distraction. You'll struggle to achieve the deepest level of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom.

If every moment of potential boredom in your life is relieved by a quick glance at your smart phone, your brain is re-wired in such a way that it can't do deep work at all.

## Multi-tasking

People who multi-task all the time can't filter out irrelevancy or manage a working memory. They are chronically distracted.

## The "Internet Sabbath"

... is a bad idea. One day a week offline followed by normal distracted/multi-tasked work is like eating healthy one day a week, then eating junk food for the rest of that week. You won't get in shape.

Regardless of how you schedule your internet use, you must keep it only within the scheduled "distraction  blocks". This includes use outside of working hours.

## Put More Thought into your Leisure Time

Don't Use the Internet to Entertain Yourself. The quality of leisure time will be degraded, reduced to a blur of distorted clicks on least-common-denominator digital entertainment.

Put more thought into your leisure time. Figure out what you're going to do in your evenings and weekends before they begin.

If you give your mind something meaningful to do throughout your working hours, you'll end the day more fulfilled and begin the next one more relaxed. Don't allow your mind to bathe for hours in semi-conscious, unstructured web-surfing.

## Drain the Shallows

Confine shallow work to a window. Typically, 4 hours is the maximum you can spend in a state of depth.

## Schedule Every Minute of your Day

We spend much of our day on auto-pilot, not giving much thought to what we do with our time. This is a problem. Divide your day into 30 minute intervals, groups of which are "blocks". They can be "task blocks" or "distraction blocks".

If interrupted, take a few minutes to create a revised schedule for the time that remains in the day. The goal is not to stick to it at all costs, but to maintain, at all times, a thoughtful say in what you're doing with your time going forward, even if those decisions get re-worked again and again as the day unfolds.

Use "overflow conditional" blocks if you're not sure how long a task will take. If you stumble upon an important insight, ignore the schedule and stick with it until it loses steam. Then, when finished, step back and rebuild the schedule with the remaining time in the day.

It's not about constraint, it's about thoughtfulness.

## Ask your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

You'll almost certainly end up forced to say no to projects that seem infused with shallowness while also more aggressively reducing the amount oof shallowness in your existing projects.

Finish your work by 5:30.

## Stop Saying "Yes"

The most dangerous word in the productivity vocabulary is "yes". Be incredibly cautious about your use of it.

Be clear in your refusal to take on a shallow obligation, but ambiguous in your explanation. "I have schedule conflicts" is a better explanation than "I have to meet Joe at 2:30". This takes away the requester's ability to diffuse it. Also, don't offer a consolation prize. Set the expectation that the default answer is no.

Make people who send you e-mail do more work. 

Do more work when you send/reply to e-mail. Ask yourself "What is the most efficient way to bring this thread/project to a successful conclusion".

Don't respond if the sender hasn't put in effort. 

Develop the habit of letting small bad things happen. If you don't, you won't have time for life-changing big things.
